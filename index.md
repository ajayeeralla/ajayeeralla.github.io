## About Me

I am working as a Senior Formal Verification Engineer at [AMD Inc](https://www.amd.com/en). Previously, I worked as a Software Research Engineer for [Galois Inc](https://galois.com/).

## Research Interests
- **Software:** Formal verification, computer security, cryptography, SMT/SAT solvers, theorem proving, software engineering, and cybersecurity, and unification problems modulo equational theories
- **Hardware:** Formal verification of RTL designs using EDA vendor tools such as [VC-Formal](https://www.synopsys.com/verification/static-and-formal-verification/vc-formal.html) and [JasperGold](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/system-design-and-verification/formal-and-static-verification/jasper-gold-verification-platform.html).
